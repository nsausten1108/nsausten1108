This is a shape selector program I made in Java for a college class. It utilizes GUI inputs to select whether a user wants to work with a 2d shape or 3d shape, then gives the user a choice of shapes. From there, a user inputs the values to calculate the area (for a 2d shape) or volume (for a 3d shape). Pictures are included to be displayed to show the end user what a shape looks like.
